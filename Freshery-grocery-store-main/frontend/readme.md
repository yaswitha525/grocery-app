**ShopSmart** is a responsive, user-friendly digital grocery store frontend built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. It allows users to browse, filter, and sort over 25 grocery items, each with real images and detailed descriptions. Users can add items to their cart with a single click and view totals in real-time. The interface fetches product data from a connected Express.js + MongoDB backend through Axios. Designed with modern UI principles, the app ensures a smooth and engaging shopping experience, complete with toast notifications and responsive layouts for all devices.
